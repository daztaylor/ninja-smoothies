## JoshuaPCarr
Currently new to Vue.js and never heard of Firebase prior to the Udemy course. This repo is the result of following along with the Udemy course described below and only contains the first project of the course. I attempt to commit every episode to give a good understanding of what each lecture contains. The other projects in the course will have their own seperate repos under this same github account.

## [Project One - Udemy \"Build Web App with Vue JS & Firebase\" - Shaun Pelling](https://www.udemy.com/build-web-apps-with-vuejs-firebase/)

## Description
If you're looking to get started building full-stack applications with Vue JS and Firebase, then look no further. In this course I'll take you from novice to ninja in Vue JS, starting out with the very basics of VueJS and then moving on towards creating fully-fledged VueJS applications. 

We'll spend a whole chapter learning about the Vue Router - and how to create SPA's (single page applications) using it - as well as exploring how to use the Vue CLI to get up and running quickly when creating Vue applications.

I'll also teach you how to use Firebase, an online, free service provided by Google which acts as a very feature-rich, fully-fledged back-end to our applications. We'll learn how to use Firebase to store and retrieve data to and from a NoSQL database called Firestore, as well as authenticate our app's users with the Firebase Auth service, We'll also take a peak at Firebase Cloud Functions (which allow us to run server-side JavaScript code in a Node.js environment), as well as deploying all of our applications to Firebase hosting.

There's a crazy amount to cover, but by the end of this course you'll be in a position to create full-stack web applications (complete with user authentication) using Vue JS and Firebase!

This course is built with Vue 2.x, and will be added to with extra sections in the future.
